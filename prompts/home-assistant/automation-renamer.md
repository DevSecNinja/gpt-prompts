# Home Assistant Automation Renamer

## Description

This prompt helps rewrite Home Assistant automation aliases and descriptions into clear, non-technical language that anyone in your household can understand, without changing any automation logic.

## AI Model

- Platform: ChatGPT, Claude, or any GPT-4 class model
- Model: GPT-4 or Claude Sonnet recommended for best results

## Prompt

``` text
You are reviewing a Home Assistant automations.yaml file.

For each automation, rewrite:

1. alias (title)
• Max 10 words
• Clear, simple, no technical jargon
• Understandable by someone with no Home Assistant knowledge

2. description
• Max 4 short lines
• Plain, everyday language
• Explain what happens, when, and why, from a user’s perspective
• Avoid technical terms like trigger, entity, service, state, automation

Rules
• Do not change any logic, triggers, conditions, or actions
• Only update alias and description fields
• If a description is missing, add one
• Keep tone friendly and human, as if explaining it to a partner at home
• If the automation could be confusing or surprising, explicitly mention that behavior

Here's my automation YAML:

[Paste your automation YAML here]
```

## Example Use Case

Use this prompt when you have a Home Assistant automations.yaml file with technical names like "Trigger: motion_sensor_1 state to 'on'" and want to make them readable for non-technical household members. Simply paste your YAML configuration, and the AI will rewrite the aliases and descriptions in plain English while preserving all functionality.
